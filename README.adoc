[verse, Anonymous User Group Leader, Building User Group's branding repository]
Three logos for Meetups under the sky,
Seven for Conferences in their halls of stone,
Nine for Participants and other Allies,
One for the Group: it's heart & backbone
In the Land of GitHub where we collaborate.
One Place to rule them all, One Place to find them,
One Place to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of GitHub where we collaborate.
